title: Do not ask for Prism Launcher support in direct/voice chats!
color: red

We do not recommend support in DMs or VCs. This is because:

- You are forcing the person to commit to helping you. Everyone that helps out in support channels is a volunteer and isn't obligated to help you.
- The person trying to help you may give a bad answer, whether due to lack of knowledge, language barriers or out of malice, and they cannot be easily corrected by others.
- You are slowing down your response time by banking on one person to be available rather than asking in a forum where there will usually be someone with expertise.
- Most people who actively help others here will redirect you to the support forum anyways. You might as well save your and their time by asking in the proper space.
- VCs require people to reveal their voice. Not everyone is comfortable with this and it's often harder to resolve via VC anyways.
