Please __upload your log directly from Prism's Upload feature__ after reproducing your issue. **Edit** > **Minecraft log** > **Upload**. __Paste the resuling URL in this channel__
-# Uploading a log as a file means anyone helping you has to download the log and open it in a text editor themselves. Discord only shows 500 lines of a log under "View Entire File".
