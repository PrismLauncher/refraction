title: Why PluralKit?

Plurality is the existence of multiple self-aware entities inside the same brain.

Each member of a system/collective (group residing inside the same physical brain) is an individual person, so please treat them as such.

On Discord, some systems may use [PluralKit](https://pluralkit.me/) to make their message appear with the correct profile, resulting in a `[BOT]` tag.

For more information about plurality, we recommend [More Than One](https://morethanone.info/) for a useful overview.

**Note: We do NOT tolerate the use of PluralKit for role playing.**
