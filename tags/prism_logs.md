If you have an issue with Prism Launcher specifically, make sure to __send your log__ after reproducing your issue. 
* On Prism Launcher 10.0.0+: **Prism** > **top toolbar** > **Help** > **View logs** > **Upload**.
* On Prism Launcher 9.4-(You should really update if you're not on 10.0.0+ already): **Prism** > **top toolbar** > **Folders** > **Logs**, then upload the `PrismLauncher-0.log` or `PrismLauncher-0` file to [mclo.gs](https://mclo.gs/), and send the link to the support chat.
