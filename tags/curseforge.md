CurseForge has an option to block third party clients like Prism Launcher from accessing mod files and modpacks. For blocked modpacks, as a workaround you can download the modpack from the website manually, and import it by going to Add instance > Import. For blocked mods in modpacks, Prism Launcher offers a workaround by allowing you to download these mods from your browser and automatically importing them into the instance. We highly encourage asking authors that opted out of client downloads to stop doing so.
