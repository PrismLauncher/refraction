Please be patient and wait for somebody to give support. Reposting your question in multiple channels can be disruptive for others in the channel. This also doesn't get you support quicker.

If you change your mind about where something should be or somebody asks you to move it another channel, that's fine. But, please don't hop between channels trying to get attention.

Also, we'd like it if you could delete the original message if you make a mistake where to put it the first time.
